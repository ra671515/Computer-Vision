This repository contains a Python script that loads and displays images using the OpenCV library.

## images.py Script

The `images.py` script in the Files folder loads an image from the Images folder and displays it using OpenCV. The script is a simple demonstration of how to use OpenCV to load and display images.

## Images Folder

I've added two images to the Images folder:

image1.jpg: a picture of a cat
image2.jpg: a picture of a dog

These images can be used as input for the `images.py` script.

## Getting Started

To use the `images.py` script, simply run it from the command line or terminal, and it will load and display the image. You can replace the `image.jpg` file with any other image file in the Images folder.
